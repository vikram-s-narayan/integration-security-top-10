# ISF-8 Playbook: Blind Trust in Transitive Integrations

## Risk
Downstream chains create hidden trust paths.

## Objective
Map and monitor transitive data flows.

## Steps
1. Inventory – Trace integration call chains.
2. Policy – Approve only mapped flows.
3. Enforce – Use API gateways for flow control.
4. Automate – Graph monitoring tools.
5. Review – Annual trust map refresh.

## Success Criteria
All downstream flows documented.
